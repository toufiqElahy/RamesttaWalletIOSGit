Normally this file should be about update history but since this is an iPhone app, we took the convenience to keep the update procedure to AppStore here.

- Ensure the build is incremented by bundle and build number
- Backward test against previous builds to ensure that it doesn't break previous versions
- Ensure travis CI is passing
- Run through all the major functions - Redeem, transfer, sell, backup and restore key
- Ensure contract for any placeholder event is correct and working with Payment Server
- Update the app store description and keywords in each localised langauge.
